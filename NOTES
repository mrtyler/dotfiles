bashrc:

Shell config files are the most complex and the most likely to change
between sites, so their architecture is the most confusing.

1. bashrc.template is copied into ~/.bashrc, because that's where bash
   expects to find its config. This file sources the local config
   file.

2. The local config file calls the system config for that system.

3. The local config file sets ups various needed variables, and then
   calls the common config file.

4. The local config file then finishes setting up or overrides
   anything from the common config file that is system-dependent.
